A plugin that allows you to make a field with sub fields.

== Description ==

A plugin that allows you to make a field with sub fields. Largely based off of the repeater plugin from ACF. It basically does exactly the same thing, but limits you to exactly 1 "row". The interface for accessing data inside of a group is exactly the same as accessing it in a repeater.

= Compatibility =

This ACF field type is compatible with:

* ACF 4

== Installation ==

1. Copy the `acf-groups` folder into your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2. Activate the Groups plugin via the plugins admin page
3. Create a new field via ACF and select the Groups type
4. Please refer to the description for more info regarding the field type settings
